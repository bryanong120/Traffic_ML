In this project, we explore a way to combine road security and ICT industries and develop a cross-industry application. Specifically, we focus on road security and safety. Data drive traffic accident root cause quantification models will be developed with explainable artificial intelligence (AI).

In the past decades, the rapid growth of motor vehicles leads to a dramatically increased number of Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs), which forces countries all around the world to provide severe reactions and strategies. However, RTA is a phenomenon caused by complex coupling relations among different accident factors, including humans, vehicles, roads, and the environment. Thus, generating precise explanations of traffic incidents is critical but not straightforward, and it requires intelligent solutions and urgent actions. This project aims to develop an integrated traffic accident modeling and explanation system. Two major judgments related to a traffic accident are considered: accident severity level and affected length of the road extent in an accident.

Our solution will introduce several data engineering skills, especially, some state-of-the-art AI technologies. Besides, both data features and internal AI model mechanisms will be considered. E.g. for features, a partial dependence plot (PDP) will be used to analyze the marginal effect; for model mechanism, interpretable machine learning algorithms will be adopted as surrogates. The performance of the model and corresponding explanation should also be visualized in a proper way.

Overall, this project can help the student to gain a comprehensive and practical understanding of utilizing ICT technologies in a different sector.
